      <h2>Innovation Claim</h2>
      <p>An integrated power and fiber distribution unit allows for efficient use of cabling and tower space. This lowers infrastructure costs, time to deploy, and allows for site expansion with minimal investments. The ability to diagnose power circuit issues from the ground reduces the need for climbers to ascend the tower, increasing site safety and further reducing costs.</p>

      <h2>Project Description</h2>
      <p>This project aims to add advanced features to an existing innovative prototype. This prototype has been a work in progress to fill a void encountered while designing and standing up fixed wireless sites. This is a solo project where I will wear all the hats. I will need to enhance my knowledge of microcontrollers, programming, and how to secure IoT devices. Between self-study and coursework, the timeline to develop the necessary skills should align with a natural progression of the SIP framework and allow for an MVP by the end.</p>

      <h3>Visuals</h3>

      <p>The company I work for has been rapidly expanding our service using fixed wireless. I have been trying to optimize site design, with an eye towards site expansion in the future. This image is the first iteration of a solution I designed to fill a void, efficient fiber distribution near the base node.</p>

      <!-- Second image with caption -->
      <img src="VenturaTank.jpg" alt="Second iteration, with DC power protection and distribution" style="width:800px;height:auto;">
      <p>This image showcases further innovation on the idea. Here I have added DC circuit protection and distribution. This dramatically lowered costs for this build by eliminating the need for up to six individual copper runs for the full span of the tower.</p>
      
      <h3>Other Materials</h3>
      
      <img src="MonDiag.png" alt="Monitor circuit diagram" style="width:800px;height:auto;">
      <p>This image shows the idea for the layout of the monitoring and reporting system. Upon feedback from my SME, I have begun research into building out an LTE modem for data communication. I am also planning to build out a solar and battery system for powering the microcontroller. These two innovations would allow this solution to report, even in conditions that take the site down. This offers redundancy that provides several benefits to security and network diagnostics. </p>
